We will use conda to setup a new virtual environment using the provided `.yaml` file.

To setup your environment, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Anaconda (or miniconda) installed. The software has been tested on Ubuntu 21.10 using miniconda version 4.10.3

2. Create a conda environment using the provided .yaml file as follows: `conda env create --file=brianenv2.yaml`

3. Activate the environment in conda: `conda activate brianenv2`

4. Run the simulation (-i drops you in an -interactive python console after simulation ends): `python3 -i run_sim_dumb.py`
